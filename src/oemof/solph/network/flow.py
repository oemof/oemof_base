class Flow(on.Edge):
    r"""Defines a flow between two nodes.

    Keyword arguments are used to set the attributes of this flow. Parameters
    which are handled specially are noted below.
    For the case where a parameter can be either a scalar or an iterable, a
    scalar value will be converted to a sequence containing the scalar value at
    every index. This sequence is then stored under the paramter's key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nominal_value : numeric, :math:`P_{nom}`
        The nominal value of the flow. If this value is set the corresponding
        optimization variable of the flow object will be bounded by this value
        multiplied with min(lower bound)/max(upper bound).
    max : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{max}`
        Normed maximum value of the flow. The flow absolute maximum will be
        calculated by multiplying :attr:`nominal_value` with :attr:`max`
    min : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{min}`
        Normed minimum value of the flow (see :attr:`max`).
    fix : numeric (iterable or scalar), :math:`f_{actual}`
        Normed fixed value for the flow variable. Will be multiplied with the
        :attr:`nominal_value` to get the absolute value. If :attr:`fixed` is
        set to :obj:`True` the flow variable will be fixed to `fix
        * nominal_value`, i.e. this value is set exogenous.
    positive_gradient : :obj:`dict`, default: `{'ub': None, 'costs': 0}`
        A dictionary containing the following two keys:

         * `'ub'`: numeric (iterable, scalar or None), the normed *upper
           bound* on the positive difference (`flow[t-1] < flow[t]`) of
           two consecutive flow values.
         * `'costs``: numeric (scalar or None), the gradient cost per
           unit.

    negative_gradient : :obj:`dict`, default: `{'ub': None, 'costs': 0}`

        A dictionary containing the following two keys:

          * `'ub'`: numeric (iterable, scalar or None), the normed *upper
            bound* on the negative difference (`flow[t-1] > flow[t]`) of
            two consecutive flow values.
          * `'costs``: numeric (scalar or None), the gradient cost per
            unit.

    summed_max : numeric, :math:`f_{sum,max}`
        Specific maximum value summed over all timesteps. Will be multiplied
        with the nominal_value to get the absolute limit.
    summed_min : numeric, :math:`f_{sum,min}`
        see above
    variable_costs : numeric (iterable or scalar)
        The costs associated with one unit of the flow. If this is set the
        costs will be added to the objective expression of the optimization
        problem.
    fixed : boolean
        Boolean value indicating if a flow is fixed during the optimization
        problem to its ex-ante set value. Used in combination with the
        :attr:`fix`.
    investment : :class:`Investment <oemof.solph.options.Investment>`
        Object indicating if a nominal_value of the flow is determined by
        the optimization problem. Note: This will refer all attributes to an
        investment variable instead of to the nominal_value. The nominal_value
        should not be set (or set to None) if an investment object is used.
    nonconvex : :class:`NonConvex <oemof.solph.options.NonConvex>`
        If a nonconvex flow object is added here, the flow constraints will
        be altered significantly as the mathematical model for the flow
        will be different, i.e. constraint etc. from
        :class:`NonConvexFlow <oemof.solph.blocks.NonConvexFlow>`
        will be used instead of
        :class:`Flow <oemof.solph.blocks.Flow>`.
        Note: at the moment this does not work if the investment attribute is
        set .
    multiobjective: :class:`oemof.solph.options.MultiObjective`
        Object indicating if multiple objectives should be added for this
        flow. To be used together with
        :class:`oemof.solph.models.MultiObjectiveModel` to generate
        multi objective program.

    Notes
    -----
    The following sets, variables, constraints and objective parts are created
     * :py:class:`~oemof.solph.blocks.Flow`
     * :py:class:`~oemof.solph.blocks.InvestmentFlow` (additionally if
       Investment object is present)
     * :py:class:`~oemof.solph.blocks.MultiObjectiveFlow` (additionally if
       MultiObjective object is present)
     * :py:class:`~oemof.solph.blocks.NonConvexFlow` (If
        nonconvex  object is present, CAUTION: replaces
        :py:class:`~oemof.solph.blocks.Flow` class and a MILP will be build)

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a fixed flow object:

    >>> f = Flow(fix=[10, 4, 4], variable_costs=5)
    >>> f.variable_costs[2]
    5
    >>> f.fix[2]
    4

    Creating a flow object with time-depended lower and upper bounds:

    >>> f1 = Flow(min=[0.2, 0.3], max=0.99, nominal_value=100)
    >>> f1.max[1]
    0.99
